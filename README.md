# Analysis of Excess Mortality in Germany 2016-2022 using R

## Introduction
Mortality varies within each year and also across years. The Covid-19 pandemic has changed seasonal patterns of mortality (at least this is the presumption here). I investigate seasonal excess mortality using a simple linear regression model.

## Data
Mortality data for Germany are published by the [German Statistical Office (Destatis)](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Sterbefaelle-Lebenserwartung/Tabellen/sonderauswertung-sterbefaelle.html).
